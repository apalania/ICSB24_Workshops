# ICSB '24
Materials accompanying two pre-conference workshops that I presented at the 23rd International Conference on Systems Biology 2024, held at IIT Bombay from Nov. 30 - Dec. 5, 2024. 

- **Crash course in Python for Biology**
- **Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks using Keras**

Each workshop was for *three* hours, with presentation and hands-on activities with Jupyter (.ipynb) notebooks. The notebooks are captured here as **Open Educational Resources**. To know more about the workshops, read the workshop description files and consult the respective folders.

**Credits**: 
The materials represent a subset of two semester-long courses that I teach regularly at SASTRA University. I would like to thank my doctoral student, Mrs Ida Priyadarshini, for helping put together the materials.
