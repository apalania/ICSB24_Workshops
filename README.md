# Workshops @ ICSB '24
Materials accompanying a sequence of two pre-conference workshops that I presented at the 23rd International Conference on Systems Biology 2024, held at IIT Bombay from Nov. 30 - Dec. 5, 2024. 

- ## [Crash course in Python for Biology](https://github.com/apalania/ICSB24_Workshops/tree/main/W5_Py4bio)
- ## [Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks using Keras](https://github.com/apalania/ICSB24_Workshops/tree/main/W6_ANNwKeras)

Each workshop was for *three* hours, with presentation and hands-on activities with Jupyter (.ipynb) notebooks. The notebooks are captured here as **Open Educational Resources**. To know more about the workshops, read the workshop description files and consult the respective folders.

I expect that these resources will evolve in due course as a full-fledged concise introduction to computational thinking/AI/ML in Python, *from scratch*. Also check out [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AshokPL) for some videos on these topics.

**Credits**: 
The materials represent a subset of two semester-long courses that I teach regularly at SASTRA University. I would like to thank my doctoral student, Mrs Ida Priyadarshini, for helping put together the materials.
