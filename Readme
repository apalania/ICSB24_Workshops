# ICSB '24
Materials accompanying workshops for the 23rd International Conference on Systems Biology 2024, held at IIT Bombay from Nov. 30 - Dec. 5, 2024.
I delivered the following two pre-conference workshops, both on Nov.30:

- ## Crash course in Python for Biology
- ## Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks using Keras

Each workshop was for three hours, with presentation and hands-on activities with Jupyter (ipynb) notebooks. The notebooks are captured here as Open Educational Resources.
To know more about the workshops, consult the respective folders.

### Credits: I would like to thank my doctoral student, Mrs Ida Priyadarshini, SASTRA University for helping prepare the materials.
